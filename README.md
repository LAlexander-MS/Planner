# Planner
The planner is a CRUD web application that allows the user to keep track and manage work and personal life. This is the start of work-life balance.
# Why
Every new year I keep at least two planners. One to manage my personal life and another to manage my worklife. I love keeping planners but I tend to overlap my planners while neglecting another planner that I specifically purchased for a specific category. I lose track of managaing personal life activities because I tend to focus more on my worklife planner that personal life events are neglected. This application combines and remembers all information and reminds me when to take the proper action to keep my life happy and in order.
# How it Works (in progress)
Users begin by creating a new.....(finish how too)
# Technologies involved
* Java with Spring Boot, Hibernate and MYSQL on the backend
* HTML/CSS and Bootstrap for some level of responsiveness on the frontend
# Other Notes
After completing LaunchCode's LC101 class, I built this project to practice some of the Java skills I learned in the class as well as experiment with Bootstrap.
